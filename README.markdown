## Cheap English morphology

This package is written to help you with things related to how English
words are formed, eg. plurals, word endings, part of speech agreement,
'a' vs 'an' determiner choices.

It's not meant to provide anything resembling a full account of English
morphology. You're still going to need a list of exceptions or perhaps
someday work with a more advanced package. The goal of this package is
to hit that some bang, no buck, sweet spot so you can crank something
out quickly and hopefully replace at a better time.
